Hyperdimensional Data Visualization
===================================
By Mika Jain and Philipp Steinmann

A Processing program for visualizing CSV data in high dimensions.

The program takes a CSV with number-only entries as input and displays a graph in the form of discrete points, a best-fit mesh, or a best-fit surface.

The first three dimensions are represented spatially. The values of the fourth dimension are shown one at a time, and the the user can cycle through them using the mouse. The fifth, sixth, and seventh dimensions are represented by correspondingly high amounts of red, green, and blue, respectively.

**Controls**
- Pan: Arrow keys
- Zoom: Mouse wheel
- Rotate: Drag mouse
- Cycle 4th Dimension: Hold W-Key + drag mouse
